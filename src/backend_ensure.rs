//! Auto-provision the `octos` server backend so a fresh octoscode install
//! "just works" without a separate manual `octos` download.
//!
//! octoscode is a *client*: a local launch spawns `octos serve --stdio` as a
//! child (`--stdio-command`). Before the TUI takes over the terminal, this
//! module makes sure `octos` is available and, if it is missing, installs it —
//! **binary-only** by downloading the prebuilt server bundle for the EXACT octos
//! release this client is built against ([`REQUIRED_OCTOS_RELEASE`]) into
//! `~/.octos/bin`, on every platform octos ships a bundle for (Windows `.zip`,
//! macOS/Linux `.tar.gz`). Pinning the exact release keeps client and server
//! protocols matched — a package manager (`brew`/`npm`) installs whatever its
//! `latest` tag is (for octos, a weeks-old STABLE), so it's only a fallback for
//! a platform with no prebuilt bundle. We deliberately do NOT run octos's
//! `install.sh` / `install.ps1`: those register a background `octos-serve`
//! service (a `sudo` daemon on Unix, an `OctosServe` scheduled task on Windows),
//! which a stdio client neither needs nor should trigger.
//!
//! Two-channel note. octoscode itself now ships prereleases on channels separate
//! from stable — npm's `next` dist-tag (`@octos-org/octoscode@next`) and a
//! `octoscode-dev` Homebrew formula (stable stays `latest` / `octoscode`; see
//! `dist-workspace.toml` and `cmd::update`). The octos SERVER installed HERE does
//! NOT yet have that: its npm/brew publish only to `latest` / the stable formula,
//! so a package manager can only ever fetch a stable server. That's another
//! reason we pin the EXACT [`REQUIRED_OCTOS_RELEASE`] binary here rather than
//! trusting `brew`/`npm` `latest`. Giving the server matching `@next` /
//! `octos-serve-dev` channels (in the octos repo) is a tracked follow-up.
//!
//! We resolve octos against BOTH `PATH` and the installer dir `~/.octos/bin`.
//! When it's usable only in that dir (not on `PATH`): on Unix we rewrite the
//! stdio command to the full path; on Windows we leave the command bare and the
//! stdio transport prepends `~/.octos/bin` to the *child's* PATH (a quoted path
//! in the command string is mangled by `cmd /C`). Either way we never mutate
//! our own process PATH (octoscode forbids `unsafe`).
//!
//! Scope — it acts on a `Mode::Protocol` launch whose `--stdio-command`'s
//! **leading program** is a bare `octos` (PATH-resolved). Trailing args may
//! carry shell syntax (`--data-dir ~/x`, a Windows `C:\...` path, a pipe): we
//! still probe/install, since only the *rewrite* to an off-PATH path needs
//! round-trippable syntax — and that rewrite bails to a clear "add octos to
//! PATH" error when it can't. An explicit octos path, a `PATH=` override, or a
//! non-octos program is the user's own setup and is left untouched. An octos
//! older than [`MIN_OCTOS_VERSION`] surfaces a clear "please update" error
//! rather than guessing which package manager owns it. Opt out of install with
//! `OCTOSCODE_NO_AUTO_INSTALL=1`.
