//! Inline-viewport driver: owns the scrollback-flush bookkeeping that turns
//! octoscode's "rebuild everything every frame" model into codex's "finalized
//! history → scrollback, live UI → inline viewport" model.
//!
//! The event loop ([`crate::event_loop`]) calls [`ScrollbackTracker::sync`] each
//! time it is about to draw. The tracker compares the committed message history
//! to what it has already pushed into the terminal's scrollback and returns the
//! *new* finalized lines to insert (and whether the prior scrollback must be
//! reset first, e.g. on a session switch or a hydrate that replaced history).
//!
//! Keeping this state in one small, unit-tested type — separate from the
//! escape-sequence emitter and the render code — is what makes the rearchitecture
//! reviewable: the "what is finalized" decision lives here, the "how to draw the
//! live UI" decision lives in [`crate::app`], and the "how to write scrollback"
//! mechanism lives in [`crate::insert_history`].
