## Intent

Livediff's most transferable idea is not its file watcher architecture, but the
way it makes a diff scannable: a compact file badge, visible `+/-` counts,
strong file/hunk headers, and selection that lands on the first real change.
Apply those local rendering patterns to octoscode's inline AppUI diff preview.

## Decisions

- Keep AppUI as the source of truth. Do not add file watching, ignore engines,
  or a Livediff-style split pane.
- Reuse the existing `DiffPreviewPaneState` selected file/hunk state.
- Render the selected file/hunk in the inline preview rather than always the
  first file/hunk.
- Prefer the first hunk containing an added/removed line when a diff result is
  applied. Metadata-only hunks remain visible but are not the default target
  when a real code change exists.
- Use simple ASCII file type badges (`RUST`, `TOML`, `JSON`, `FILE`, ...);
  avoid Nerd Font dependency.

## Completion Conditions

Scenario: Inline file header is scan-friendly
  Test: render_inline_diff_header_shows_file_badge_and_counts
  Given an inline diff preview for a Rust file
  When the transcript renders
  Then the file header includes a file type badge, status, additions/deletions,
       and path.

Scenario: Selected hunk is rendered
  Test: render_inline_diff_shows_selected_hunk_not_always_first
  Given a diff preview with multiple hunks
  When selected hunk is the second hunk
  Then the inline preview shows the second hunk and hides the first hunk body.

Scenario: Result defaults to first real change
  Test: diff_preview_result_selects_first_changed_hunk
  Given a diff preview whose first hunk is metadata/context-only
  When the result is applied
  Then the selected hunk is the first hunk with added/removed lines.

Scenario: Wrapped diff rows keep the code's own whitespace
  Test: diff_content_rows_preserve_indentation_and_interior_spacing
  Given a diff content line carrying leading indentation and an interior run
       of spaces
  When the row is wrapped into the columns left of the sign gutter
  Then the leading indentation is preserved
  And interior space runs are not collapsed
  And a row too wide for the budget keeps its indent on the first row while
       continuations start at the content column.

## Non-goals

- No character-level intra-line diff.
- No live file watcher or ignore management.
- No full-screen split-pane diff reviewer.
