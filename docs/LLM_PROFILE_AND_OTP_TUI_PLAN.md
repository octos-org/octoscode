# Octoscode Login And LLM Provider UX PRD

## Purpose

This document is the ground truth for octoscode onboarding, login, and LLM
provider configuration. Implementation must follow this document before changing
TUI behavior or AppUI request shapes.

The TUI must not own a separate model/provider registry. It renders server
truth from AppUI and writes profile LLM configuration through the same profile
JSON schema used by the dashboard.

## Reference Review

Codex starts unauthenticated users in a dedicated onboarding/auth screen. The
auth widget initially shows only login choices, then transitions into the chosen
flow. API-key entry is a separate masked input state; it is not mixed into the
normal chat screen.

Claude Code uses first-run onboarding steps. Login is a focused auth step with a
method picker and pending/error/success states. Model choice is separate and is
available later through command UI, not blended into initial login.

Octos web currently supports email OTP login through:

- `GET /api/auth/status`
- `POST /api/auth/send-code`
- `POST /api/auth/verify`
- `GET /api/auth/me`
- `POST /api/auth/logout`

After OTP verification, the web client stores the returned token, calls
`/api/auth/me`, and persists the selected profile id from the server response.
For octoscode, email OTP is the only supported login method for now. Admin token
or API-key login must not appear in the TUI unless a future protocol revision
explicitly advertises and documents it.

The dashboard LLM page is the model configuration source of truth. Its schema is
model family -> model name -> route/API provider. Routes include official
endpoints and alternatives such as AutoDL and WiseModel. Custom providers use a
custom family id, model id, base URL, API key env name, API type, and test
action.

## UX Contract

First launch while unauthenticated shows an empty login surface, not chat and
not model configuration. The only login choice for Octos today is:

- Sign in with Email OTP

The login flow is:

1. Probe `auth/status`.
2. Let the user enter an email.
3. Send code through `auth/send_code`.
4. Let the user enter the OTP code.
5. Verify through `auth/verify`.
6. Store the returned token in the TUI auth state.
7. Call `auth/me`.
8. Resolve the server-selected profile.
9. Enter normal TUI mode.

LLM setup is post-login. Users configure LLM providers with `/provider` and
select among configured models with `/model`. `/onboard` may remain as a guided
convenience command, but it must reuse the same login and provider state as
`/login` and `/provider`; it must not define a second provider workflow.

Shared terminal UX requirements:

- Editable onboarding/provider fields use the same composer contract as the
  coding screen: paste appends literal text, multi-line paste remains visible
  where the field accepts it, and very large pasted values must state clearly
  that the full value is retained.
- If tmux or a terminal sends paste as a rapid key burst instead of bracketed
  paste, embedded Enter keys are still treated as pasted newlines.
- Composer and field-edit surfaces resize with input length, wrapping width, and
  terminal height, while preserving enough surrounding menu context to avoid
  hiding the selected row.
- Provider/onboarding field editors inherit composer shortcuts, including
  `Ctrl+A/E/B/F`, `Ctrl+W`, `Ctrl+K`, `Ctrl+D`, `Alt+B/F/D`, and
  `Alt+Backspace`.
- Over-budget input shows the tail/current edit position rather than the first
  line only.
- Provider test progress is scoped to the selected provider/field. Rows below
  the active test must not display a false "test in progress" state.

## Dashboard LLM Schema

The TUI must preserve this dashboard schema exactly when sending or decoding LLM
profile state:

```ts
interface ModelHints {
  uses_completion_tokens?: boolean
  fixed_temperature?: boolean
  lacks_vision?: boolean
  merge_system_messages?: boolean
}

interface LlmRouteConfig {
  route_id?: string | null
  label?: string | null
  base_url?: string | null
  api_key_env?: string | null
  api_type?: string | null
}

interface LlmModelSelectionConfig {
  family_id?: string | null
  model_id?: string | null
  route?: LlmRouteConfig | null
  model_hints?: ModelHints | null
  cost_per_m?: number | null
  strong?: boolean | null
}

interface LlmProfileConfig {
  primary?: LlmModelSelectionConfig | null
  fallbacks?: LlmModelSelectionConfig[]
}
```

The catalog returned by `profile/llm/catalog` must preserve the dashboard catalog
shape, including endpoint-specific routes:

```json
{
  "moonshot": {
    "env": "MOONSHOT_API_KEY",
    "models": [
      {
        "id": "kimi-k2.5",
        "input": 0.6,
        "output": 2.4,
        "max_output": 65535,
        "endpoints": [
          { "id": "moonshot", "label": "Official API" },
          {
            "id": "autodl",
            "label": "AutoDL",
            "base_url": "https://www.autodl.art/api/v1",
            "api_key_env": "AUTODL_API_KEY"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Required examples:

- Moonshot Kimi through AutoDL:
  `family_id=moonshot`, `model_id=kimi-k2.5`,
  `route.route_id=autodl`,
  `route.base_url=https://www.autodl.art/api/v1`,
  `route.api_key_env=AUTODL_API_KEY`.
- MiniMax through WiseModel:
  `family_id=minimax`, `model_id=MiniMax-M2.5-highspeed`,
  `route.route_id=wisemodel`,
  `route.base_url=https://open.ospreyai.cn/v1`,
  `route.api_key_env=WISEMODEL_API_KEY`.
- Custom OpenAI-compatible provider:
  custom `family_id`, custom `model_id`, custom `route.base_url`,
  custom `route.api_key_env`, and `route.api_type=openai`.

## Provider Configuration UX

`/provider` is the dashboard-equivalent TUI workflow:

1. Refresh catalog with `profile/llm/catalog`.
2. Choose model family from the catalog, or choose custom family.
3. Choose model name from the selected family, or enter a custom model name.
4. Choose route/API provider for that model: official API, AutoDL, WiseModel, or
   any endpoint advertised by the catalog.
5. For custom or endpoint-backed routes, show/edit base URL, API key env name,
   API type, and route label.
6. Enter the API key in masked form.
7. Test with `profile/llm/test`.
8. Save with `profile/llm/upsert` as primary or fallback.
9. Refresh configured providers with `profile/llm/list`.

`/model` only selects among configured server-returned providers from
`profile/llm/list` or `profile/llm/select`. If no configured providers exist,
it directs the user to `/provider`. It must not hard-code model names.

The TUI must never render, log, snapshot, or include a raw API key in UX soak
artifacts. Raw keys may only be present in the outbound AppUI request payload
for `profile/llm/test` or `profile/llm/upsert`.

## AppUI Contract

These methods must be available over WebSocket and stdio with identical JSON-RPC
method names, params, results, and errors:

- `auth/status`
- `auth/send_code`
- `auth/verify`
- `auth/me`
- `auth/logout`
- `profile/llm/catalog`
- `profile/llm/list`
- `profile/llm/upsert`
- `profile/llm/delete`
- `profile/llm/select`
- `profile/llm/test`
- `profile/llm/fetch_models`

`profile/llm/upsert` input:

```json
{
  "profile_id": "coding",
  "selection": {
    "family_id": "moonshot",
    "model_id": "kimi-k2.5",
    "route": {
      "route_id": "autodl",
      "label": "AutoDL",
      "base_url": "https://www.autodl.art/api/v1",
      "api_key_env": "AUTODL_API_KEY",
      "api_type": "openai"
    }
  },
  "api_key": "secret-value",
  "set_primary": true
}
```

Sanitized provider state returned to TUI:

```json
{
  "profile_id": "coding",
  "primary": {
    "family_id": "moonshot",
    "model_id": "kimi-k2.5",
    "route": {
      "route_id": "autodl",
      "label": "AutoDL",
      "base_url": "https://www.autodl.art/api/v1",
      "api_key_env": "AUTODL_API_KEY"
    },
    "has_api_key": true
  },
  "fallbacks": [],
  "llm": {
    "primary": {
      "family_id": "moonshot",
      "model_id": "kimi-k2.5",
      "route": {
        "route_id": "autodl",
        "label": "AutoDL",
        "base_url": "https://www.autodl.art/api/v1",
        "api_key_env": "AUTODL_API_KEY"
      },
      "has_api_key": true
    },
    "fallbacks": []
  },
  "runtime_policy_stamp": {
    "profile_id": "coding",
    "provider": "moonshot",
    "model": "kimi-k2.5"
  }
}
```

## Implementation Rules

- `/login` owns email OTP interaction.
- `/provider` owns LLM provider configuration.
- `/onboard` may orchestrate the same actions, but it cannot keep separate
  provider shortcuts or a separate schema.
- No TUI hard-coded provider shortcut such as "Add Moonshot AutoDL" is allowed.
  Those options must come from `profile/llm/catalog`.
- No flattened provider/model request schema is allowed for provider mutation.
  Mutations send dashboard-shaped `selection`.
- TUI config files may store endpoint/profile/token preferences only. They must
  not store LLM provider definitions.
- Capability checks must disable missing server-owned methods with the exact
  missing method name.

## Testing And Soak Requirements

Unit tests must prove:

- `/login email`, `/login send-code`, `/login code`, and `/login verify` build
  the expected AppUI auth commands.
- `/provider select moonshot kimi-k2.5 autodl ...` builds a
  dashboard-shaped `selection`.
- Dashboard `LlmModelSelectionConfig` fields decode when optional or null.
- Provider menu choices are built from `profile/llm/catalog`, not hard-coded
  shortcut helpers.
- Provider test/upsert commands mask secrets in debug output and TUI state.
- `/model` renders only configured server-returned providers.

Interactive tmux soak must capture:

- login screen before auth,
- email entry,
- OTP send result,
- OTP verify result,
- account/profile resolution from `auth/me`,
- provider catalog refresh,
- family/model/route selection,
- masked API key entry,
- provider test result,
- provider save result,
- configured provider list,
- model selection from configured providers,
- a raw-secret leak scan over transcript, logs, and captures.
